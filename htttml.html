            <h2>HTML and CSS: A Brief History</h2>
            <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee as a way to structure web content. It evolved over time, with the most recent version being HTML5, which introduced better multimedia support and improved semantics.</p>
            <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> was introduced in 1996 to handle the visual styling of web pages. Before CSS, web developers used HTML to manage both content and design, which was inefficient. CSS revolutionized the way we design websites, allowing developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and much more.</p>

            <h2>What I’ve Learned So Far</h2>
            <p>As I’ve progressed in my web development journey, I’ve gained essential skills in using HTML and CSS to create structured and visually appealing web pages. Here’s a summary of my learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mastered the basics of **HTML**: I understand how to structure a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and forms.</li>
                <li>Understood how to use semantic HTML to make web pages more accessible and meaningful to search engines.</li>
                <li>Learned how to style web pages with **CSS**: I can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look of the website using CSS rules.</li>
                <li>Implemented responsive design to ensure web pages look great on all devices, using techniques like Flexbox and Grid.</li>
                <li>Created interactive UI elements using CSS transitions and hover effects to enhance the user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to continue mastering web development technologies and build websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually stunning and user-friendly. I am excited about future learning opportunities and aim to eventually build large-scale applications that can impact a wide audience.</p>
